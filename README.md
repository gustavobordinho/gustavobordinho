I started learning python two years ago, since then, i have been doing some cool stuffs with it, like creating bots and automatization scripts. I got my first job with python in early 2020, there my job was to create bots which could scrape data from different sites. I end up with 9 bots that automatized the process of collecting documents manually. Then, what before took 1 week to collect, now it is only minutes.
I also did an UI to this company that can connect to the bots and run them just by clicking a button. To this i  had to create an REST API using Tornado.

Creating bots and API's was not the only thing i did with python, i also wrote scripts to convert data from MySQL to PostgreSQL changing its structure, and i am always automatizing my own jobs, Python is LIFE!
