I started learning python two years ago, since then, i have been doing some cool stuffs with it, like creating bots and automatization scripts. I got my first job with python in early 2020, there my job was to create bots which could scrape data from different sites. I end up with 9 bots that automatized the process of collecting documents manually. Then, what before took 1 week to collect, now it is only minutes.
I also did an UI to this company that can connect to the bots and run them just by clicking a button. To do that i had to create an REST API using Tornado.

Creating bots and API's was not the only thing i did with python, i also wrote scripts to convert data from MySQL to PostgreSQL changing its structure, and i am always automatizing my own jobs, Python is LIFE!

- Frameworks i know in Python:
  - Scrapy
  - Selenium
  - Tornado
  - Flask
  - Beautiful Soup

I started learning React 1 year ago, was the most fast and cool tech to learn to me, that used my own way to practice; by reading documentation and trying each lesson. I got my first job with React 7 months  ago, there i had to create a document editor  from zero with a lot of functionalities, these features include load more, agrouping of documents, switching groups from tabs, assigning a group to a user, all admin functionalities and etc.
My knowledge in React is focused in most recent versions, which is using functional components, but i also learnt class components just for feel the improves.
As it was the coolest tech to learn, i'm always testing things and creating ideas, i know each one hook, and also how to create my own, and this combined with my experience brings me the feel that i can create everything i want with React :)

I started learning NodeJS together with React, since then, i have created CRUD REST API's using Express and Sequelize. which is the libraries i like the most to create this kind of thing. I had my first job with NodeJS when i had to create a backend for a React application. There i used MVC pattern and all REST rules. I implemented authentication using jsonwebtoken and encrypting using bcrypt.<br><br>
That was not the only project i did with Node. I also created a backend to my TCC RPG game, which can save user points, create user, and all the stuffs that normal online games does, but what i learnt of different is to send emails using Node.<br><br>
I also created a simple watermark system, that receives an image and apply some text into it. i did this by using multer.
